# Windows image with OpenSSH Service

Provides a windowsservercore image for Docker running on Windows Server 2016 with a Windows-OpenSSH Server.

This is going to be the base image four our Windows-Jenkins-Slaves.

It may absolutely not be best practise to remove the password policy but we wanted an easy to know SSH user password (handle with care).
